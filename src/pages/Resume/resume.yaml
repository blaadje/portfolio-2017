introduction:
  "Passionated by informatics since forever, I've chosen to persue my career in the web universe.
  And, as the web is constantly evolving, I never stop improving myself by doing side projects.
  Also I really love geometrics and 3d stuff and will try to progress as much as I can in this area! (My goal is to create an adventure multiplayer 3d game in web).<br /><br />
  Apart from developing <br>
  - I spend my time playing piano (classical), guitar (folk,
  electric), drums occasionally and compose acoustic or
  electronic music too.<br />
  - I like to watch stuff around me (like the ocean, the montains) and think how I would code that<br />
  - I do skateboard to always push myself to fight the fears & have a freedom feeling üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br />
  - I'm not the sporty guy but I tend to maintain a physical activity<br />
  - I love friends/prison break/you (in VO ofc) etc..."
