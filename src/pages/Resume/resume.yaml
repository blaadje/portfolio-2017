introduction:
  "Passionated by informatics since forever, I've chosen to persue my career in the web universe.
  And, As the web is constantly evolving, I never stop improving myself by doing side projects<br /><br />
  Apart from developing, I spend my time playing piano (classical), guitar (folk,
  electric) and drums occasionally. I love to compose acoustic or
  electronic music too. I'm not the sporty guy but I tend to maintain a physical activity ðŸ˜„"
